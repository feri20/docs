how to get IP address from request url:
String source =  req.getHeader("referer");
            String[] splitUp = source.split("/");
            String ipAddress = splitUp[2];

Host Header Matching:
When you use the domain, the Host header in the HTTP request matches the server_name directive in your Nginx configuration (server_name my actual ip;).
However, when you use the IP address, the Host header might not match, and Nginx could be treating the request differently.
Make sure that the Host header in your Postman request matches the specified server name.
