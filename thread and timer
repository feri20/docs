for some scheduled tasks its not necessary to use threads instead we can use timer 

defining a timer in java :

Timer timer = new Timer();
timer.schedule(new TimerTask(){
@Override
public void run(){
//task you need to be done
}
},delay)

//another example
 Timer timer = new Timer();
        TimerTask task = new TimerTask() {
            @Override
            public void run() {

            }
        };
        timer.schedule(task, 60000);


//for schedule a task to execute from starting of the spring boot project
we need to use @EnableScheduling in the main class and add @Scheduled(fixedrate=milisecond value)
on the task method in our spring bean.



//we can get any spring bean around our application by :

ApplicationContext applicationContext = SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
Service service = applicationContext.getBean(Service.class);

//define a scheduler 
put @Scheduled on the method you are going to schedule and @EnabledScheduling on the main class of application
