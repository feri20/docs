Great question! HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) ensures secure communication over the internet using SSL/TLS, 
which relies heavily on certificates and public-key cryptography (key pairs). Let me explain how it all works in a simplified way:
üîí HTTPS: How It Works (Overview)
When you open a website using https://, your browser and the server do several things to establish a secure connection:
    1. Client (browser) connects to server and requests a secure session.
    2. Server sends its SSL/TLS certificate (includes its public key).
    3. Client verifies the certificate (via Certificate Authority).
    4. If the cert is trusted, the client and server perform a key exchange.
    5. They establish a shared secret for encrypting further communication.
üìú What Is an HTTPS Certificate?
It's a digital certificate issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that:
    ‚Ä¢ Proves the website‚Äôs identity.
    ‚Ä¢ Contains the server's public key.
    ‚Ä¢ Is digitally signed by the CA.
üîë Key Pair & Certificate Generation
Step-by-Step
1. Key Pair Generation
    ‚Ä¢ The server (website owner) generates:
        ‚ó¶ A private key (kept secret).
        ‚ó¶ A public key (shared in the certificate).
    ‚Ä¢ Tools: OpenSSL or similar can do this.

command :  openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048 ******

2. Create CSR (Certificate Signing Request)
    ‚Ä¢ The server creates a CSR that includes:
        ‚ó¶ Its public key.
        ‚ó¶ Organization info (domain name, etc.).

command : openssl req -new -key private.key -out request.csr *******

3. Send CSR to a Certificate Authority
    ‚Ä¢ The CA verifies the domain and company.
    ‚Ä¢ If everything checks out, the CA:
        ‚ó¶ Signs the CSR using its own private key.
        ‚ó¶ Returns a certificate (public key + CA signature).
4. Server gets a certificate
    ‚Ä¢ This file is usually .crt or .pem.
    ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs installed on the server along with the private key.
üîê During HTTPS Communication
    1. Browser checks the certificate‚Äôs signature using the CA‚Äôs public key.
    2. If valid and trusted, the browser accepts the certificate.
    3. A TLS handshake happens using the public key (from the cert) to exchange a session key.
    4. All further traffic is encrypted using symmetric encryption (fast).
üß† In Summary
    ‚Ä¢ HTTPS uses SSL/TLS for secure communication.
    ‚Ä¢ Certificates use asymmetric cryptography (public/private keys).
    ‚Ä¢ The public key is in the certificate; the private key stays with the server.
    ‚Ä¢ The certificate proves identity and allows encrypted key exchange.
